<p>
Zambia is the system used by Arisia to organize and schedule our
content.  Logging into Zambia as a participant allows panelists to
indicate which panels they’d like to be on, set their availability
during the convention and create a profile/biography.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> First login</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
When you log in for the first time, you will need to update your
profile and change your password away from the default by clicking
profile on the menu bar.
</p>

<p>
From this page you can do the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Let us know if you are interested and able to participate in
programming for the upcoming convention:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If you want to be on panels or otherwise be a program
participant, set it to "Yes".
</li>
<li>If you are unable to attend this year, but want to be invited
for future years, please still log in and set it to "No".
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Let us know if we can share your e-mail address with other
participants.  Please consider saying yes so that moderators of
panels you have been selected for can contact you prior to the
convention to let you know format, and so you can discuss and prep
for the panel.  Saying no will not affect our decisions when
making panelist selections for panels.
</li>
<li>Let us know if we can photograph you while you’re participating on
panels, and if we can use those images in the promotion of the
convention.  Saying no will not affect our decisions when making
panelist selections for panels.
</li>
<li>Let us know how you want your name to appear on our electronic and
print publications.
</li>
<li>Provide us with your biography for our electronic and print
publications.  Bios are limited to 1000 characters (including
spaces).
</li>
<li>Review the contact information we have for you. Corrections can be
made by logging into our registration system (which has a separate
login process and password than Zambia.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-sec-3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Availability</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Next, please let us know about your availability, by selecting that
option from the menu in the page header. This allows us to get an
idea of what kind of schedule you’d like to have during the
convention. In addition to listing time ranges, make sure to enter
information on any constraints or conflicts that might occur on your
schedule at the bottom of the page. Be as thorough as you can and
fill out all fields on this page &#x2013; the more information we have,
the better! Please keep in mind that a narrow availability listing
makes it difficult for Arisia staff to schedule you, so please be
both honest and realistic about your con participation time!
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-4"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> General Interests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
The next section you will want fill out is General Interests. This
page is where you can provide information pertaining to your
interests, workshops or presentations you’d like to pitch to us, who
you’d like to be on panels with (or who you want to avoid).  This is
also the place to give us other information we should consider when
creating this year’s programming schedule.
</p>

<p>
Some people find that it’s best to fill out this section last, after
completing all other parts of the panel sign-up process.  You should
feel free to come back to it at the end.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Search Sessions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Next up is Search Sessions; this is how you find out what sort of
panels and other program items are available to participate
on. Because of the volume of selections that are available at
Arisia, we organize panels by tracks. There are no restrictions on
how many tracks a person can participate on; we love panelists that
have knowledge in several content areas and can participate on a
diverse range of items!
</p>

<p>
From the Sessions main page you can do the following:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Click the drop menu on the Track option. This will show you a list
of all our tracks.
</li>
<li>Select the track you’re interested in then click search. This will
give you a list of panel options for that track.
</li>
<li>Each entry has a box next to the title that you click on to add it
as a panel you are interested in being on.
</li>
<li>Once you’ve made your selections, click save. You will be taken to
a page where you can enter a rating and give reasons as to why you
would be a good choice for a given panel (see "Session Interests"
section below).
</li>
<li>Go back to the Search Sessions page to add more panels to your
list, either from the same track, or other tracks.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-6"><span class="section-number-2">6</span> Session Interests</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Once you have selected a bunch of panels you’re interested in being
on, it’s time to provide us with information for why we should place
YOU on that panel.  This is a really important step!.  We have so
many great panelists that sign up each year, so we rarely assign
people to panels that have not ranked the panel and written
something about why they would be a fabulous addition to this item.
</p>

<p>
Click on the "Session Interests" option from the menu to view all
the panels you selected earlier.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First, go through and rank all your panel selections. We use the
following rating system:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>1 &#x2013; Oooh! Oh! Pick Me!
</li>
<li>2-3 &#x2013; I'd like to if I can.
</li>
<li>4-5 &#x2013; I am qualified but this is not one of my primary
interests.
</li>
<li>You’re limited to 4 sessions each of preferences 1-4 and there’s
no limit to the number of sessions for which you can express
preference 5.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Next, write a bit in the text boxes for each panel to let us know
why you would be fabulous on that session.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Completing this step thoughtfully is especially important for
the items you rank highest.
</li>
<li>Address anything asked of panelists in the beige box associated
with that panel.
</li>
<li>This doesn’t need to be long &#x2013; a short paragraph is typical.
</li>
<li>Some panelists draft these out in a separate document and then
cut-and-paste their entries into Zambia as a final step.
</li>
<li>If you do not fill this section out, you will not get placed on
the panel, even if you rate it a 1 and feel that you’re an
obvious choice.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you are interested in moderating a particular panel, please
select that option while providing your rankings.  The panelists
most enthusiastic about a topic don’t always make the best
moderators, as moderators are facilitators in addition to
contributors on a panel, so keep this in mind when ranking and
indicating your interest in moderating.
</li>
<li>Remember to save your progress approximately every ten minutes so
that you aren’t logged out due to inactivity and lose your
selections or what you wrote!
</li>
<li>Ranking a panel as "1" and writing a thesis on why you’re perfect
for the panel does not guarantee your placement on it. Most of our
panels have more qualified people sign up for them than we have
spaces on the panel (typically 4-5), and there are more sessions
to sign up for than we have spots in the schedule.
</li>
