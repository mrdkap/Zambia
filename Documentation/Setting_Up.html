There are some required programs to run the Zambia software.  The

serve up your Zambia instance: (LAMP or WAMP (WAMP is untested))
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>apache

<li>php
</li>
<li>mysql

<li>some form of email sending software (MTA)

Either on your staging machine (where you will be uploading the

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
You will need to decide the following before you install initially:
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-1"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.1</span> Standalone/Combination</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-1">
<p>
Is this system going to be a standalone system, or are you going
to interface it with Congo, or another piece of registration software?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-2"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.2</span> Single/Multiple installation</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-2">
<p>
Is this going to be a single instantce of Zambia, or are you going
to have multiple instances of Zambia running on the same machine
with some shared resources?
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-3"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.3</span> Webserver</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-3">
<p>
Where is your web installation location (whatever directory you
will be putting your files into)?  Often something like
/var/www/Zambia-Con or /home/username/public_html/Zambia-Con or
the like.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="sec-1-2-4"><span class="section-number-4">1.2.4</span> db_name.php file</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-1-2-4">
<p>
This information will go in the db_name.php file when you install it.
</p>
</div>
<ul class="org-ul"><li>Required information for the program to run:<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-4-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Database hostname (<b>DBHOSTNAME</b>). If you are setting things up on
the same machine that MySQL is running on, <i>localhost</i> should be
what you are using for <b>DBHOSTNAME</b>.
</li>
<li>Database username (<b>DBUSERNAME</b>).  The user created for the
Zambia program to access the database(s).
</li>
<li>Database password (<b>DBPASSOWRD</b>).  The password created for the
Zambia program to access the database(s).
</li>
<li>Main database name (<b>DBDB</b>).  The database for all the single
convention specific information to live in.
</li>
<li>Biographical information database name (<b>BIODB</b>).  The database
for all the (possibly shared between Zambia instances)
biographical data.  If you are having the same people either for
multiple years, or for multiple activities, it makes sense to
centralize the information, otherwise it could be a one-shot for
the particular convention.
</li>
<li>The Reports databasse name (<b>REPORTDB</b>) points to where the
reports are kept.  It is on of the main ways of interation with
the data about the convention.  If you have multiple Zambia
instances it makes sense for this to be a single, shared
resource.
</li>
<li>The CongoDump database name (<b>CONGODB</b>). Congo is another piece of
software designed to interact with Zambia. The information in
that set of databases can be accessed in a variety of ways.
</li>
<li>The Limits (<b>LIMITDB</b>) and Localizations (<b>LOCALDB</b>) databases
are used to key things that are specific to a convention, but
might all want to live in a central database, for ease of
deploying new conventions.
</li>
<li>The TimeCard database (<b>TIMECARDDB</b>) might want to be specific to
a convention, or generalized across many different activities of
your organization, it often is local to the convention instance,
but there are some reasons to have it in a single, externally
served database.
</li>
<li>The convention database keying tag (<b>CON_KEY</b>) is useful when the
Limits and Localizations are stored in a single table, to
distinguish between which instance needs to be pulled.
</li>
<li>your host name (<b>MYHOST</b>) (If you are setting things up on the same
machine that MySQL is running on, <i>localhost</i> should be what you
are using for <b>MYHOST</b>) (this doesn't actually go in the file)
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>

<li>Extremely useful information:<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-4-2">
<p>
Most of this information, currently in the db_name.php file,
would all be candidtates to be inthe Localization database.

<li>Zambia administrator email.

HH:MM:DD for parsing purposes.  Suggested 00:00:00 for the
start time.)

<li>URL of the con (without the leading <a href="http://">http://</a> in the URL.)

<li>Logo for the con (gif, png, etc.)

<li>Availabilty Records (starting number of "availability" fields
to render in the "when I am available" form, 8 is a good
default.)

is a hold-over from backwards compatibility.)

<li>Default Duration of the classes. (How long, in H:MM format that
the classes are expected to be.)
</li>
<li>Duration in Minutes (Should probably be "FALSE": TRUE: in mmm;
False: in hh:mm - affects session edit/create page only, not
reports.)
</li>
<li>Grid Spacer (The time divisions in the fixed grid produced, in
seconds.  For example 1800 is 60 sec/min and 30 min, and a good
default.)
</li>

<li>Very useful information<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-4-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Guests of Honor badgelist (if you have specific featured Guests
of Honor, the badgeids get listed here, comma seperated.)

<li>Prefered total number of sessions upper limit (so your
presenters don't oversubscribe themselves 5 is good default for
a 3-4 day con.) (This should move to the Limits database.)

<li>Prefered daily number of sessions upper limit (3 is a good
default.) (This should move to the Limits database.)

<li>Description minimums and maximums<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-4-4">
<p>
All of this information should be migrated to the Limits
database.  Only set a value if you need it, unset values are
simply presume there is no limit to the information in that
direction.  At some point, the precis descriptions will be folded
into the same, or a similar structure to the Biographical
Information is, currently.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Minimum web biography character length (Some cons have minimum
biographical information requirements.)
</li>
<li>Maximum web biography character length (Some cons have a
different limits for what is on the web, and what is in the
book, 3000 characters is a good starting default for the WWW.)

<li>Minimum book biography character length (Some cons have minimum
biographical information requirements.)
</li>
<li>Maximum book biography character length (if there isn't a
difference in the limit, but still, there is a limit, set to
the same as the web maximum.)

<li>Minimum uri biography character length (the URI block is often
unlimited in either direction.)

<li>Minimum web precis character length (You need a precis
description of at least this long to be acceptable, 10 as a
good default.)
</li>
<li>Maximum web precis character length (3000 as a good default.)
</li>
<li>Minimum book precis character length (if there isn't a
difference in the limit, set it to the same as above for these,
as well.)
</li>
<li>Maximum book precis character length
</li>
<li>Minimum precis title character length (You need a precis title
of at least this long to be acceptable, 5 as a good default.)
</li>
<li>Maximum precis title character length (50 as a good default.)
</li>
<li>Minimum name character length (if there is a need to make sure
all names are of at least a specifc length.)
</li>
<li>Maximum name character length (if there is a need to make sure
all names are no more than a specifc length.)

<li>Other interesting settings<br  /><div class="outline-text-5" id="text-1-2-4-5">

The linguistic settings (below) will go away once the precis
descriptions are migrated to a similar format as the Biographical
information currently resides.

replace the final "Zambia" with what you decided the web install

call your staging area.

There are certain localisms you want to set up, outside the svn

is desired, it can be done, without writing over your
customizations.

To begin the process change to your web install location.  There you
should see a list of files, and you will add one called "Local".

participant view.  Another will allow you to manage Sessions.  Note
that Sessions is the generic term we are using for all Events,
Classes, Panels, BOF/SIG/MnG, other activities, etc. &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Current roles:
&lt;UL&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt;Pre-con Logistics: That tall guy, with the 'stash
  &lt;LI&gt;At-con Logistics: Bill(1)
  &lt;LI&gt;Speaker Liaison: Kat (with a "K")
  &lt;LI&gt;Assistant Speaker Liaison: Bill(2)
  &lt;LI&gt;Volunteer Captain: Cat
  &lt;LI&gt;Assistant Volunteer Captain: The Other Cat
  &lt;LI&gt;Green Room Czar: Tim
  &lt;LI&gt;Point People: Helium 1, Helium 2, and the Stupid But Cute.
  &lt;LI&gt;Schedule Wranglers: The group as a whole
  &lt;LI&gt;Technical support: Will
  &lt;LI&gt;(Tentative) Technical Support: Nyot
  &lt;LI&gt;Bio/copy editing: Rupert
&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;The general flow of sessions over time is: &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Brainstorm -
New session idea put in to the system by one of our brainstorm
users. The idea may or may not be sane or good.  It could be too big
or too small or duplicative.

  &lt;LI&gt;Edit Me - New session idea that a participant or staff member
entered.  An idea entered by a brainstorm user that is non-offensive
should be moved to this status.  These are still rough and may well
have issues.  Still could be duplicates.

  &lt;LI&gt;Vetted - A real session that we would like to see happen.  At
this point the language should be fairly close to final in the
description. Spell checking and grammar checking should have happened.
It needs have publication status, a type, kid category, division and a
room set.  Please check the duration (defaults to 1 hour) and the
various things the session might need (like power, mirrors, etc.)
This is the minimal status that participants are allowed to sign up
for.  Avoid duplicates (however the list is still approximately 3
times what will actually run).

  &lt;LI&gt;Assigned - Session has participants assigned to it.

  &lt;LI&gt; Scheduled - Session is in the schedule (do not set this by hand
as the tool actually sets this for you when you schedule it in a
room!)  The language needs to match what you want to see
&lt;b&gt;published&lt;/b&gt;.

  &lt;LI&gt; Collect anything needful, like handouts and blank surveys, or
  if it is the first class of the day, the signs, from the Green Room.
  &lt;LI&gt; Be at class 10 minutes early (at the actual end of the previous
  class).
  &lt;LI&gt; You may, if you wish, pre-stage surveys on people's seats for

  &lt;LI&gt; At the beginning of class, move to the front of the room and do
  the introduction.  The Con Blurb and the speaker(s) bio(s) as
  provided.

  sheet, when you are checking in at the end of your stint.
&lt;H3&gt;Volunteer: (outside room)&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt; Check that people coming into the room have the correct
  wristbands.  If they do not, politely send them to registration (if
  it is open) to get them.  If there is an issue, notify the point
  person.
  &lt;LI&gt; Stay at the door during class to ensure that excessive ins and
  outs don't occur.
&lt;H3&gt;Runner: (all over con)&lt;/H3&gt;
  &lt;LI&gt; Ensure that every class room has what it needs.
  &lt;LI&gt; Ensure that that A/V and supply needs of a class are met prior
  to it beginning.
  &lt;LI&gt; You can quietly and respectfully bring any supplies into the
  room as a class is going on, and make sure the Introducer knows what
  was delivered.
&lt;H3&gt;Green Room: (green room)&lt;/H3&gt;
The green room is a space designated for Presenters, Programming
Volunteers, Panelists, and Assistants only.  While you are welcome to
hang out there, it is also the Programming Team's Ground Zero, so, you

  &lt;LI&gt; Assist the Program Participants, including disseminating their
  packets as necessary.
  &lt;LI&gt; Check in and out the Introducers and Volunteers as they come on
  and off their stints.
  &lt;LI&gt; Make sure all necessary supplies are available for the
  volunteers as they arrive for check in, including any handouts.
  &lt;LI&gt; Be available to collect the surveys, etc as they arrive.
  &lt;LI&gt; Stay in the room and hang out with everyone!

You should already have mysql set up.  If mysql is not already set

The pieces of information you will need are from the above decisions
for the db_name.php file:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>database hostname: (<b>DBHOSTNAME</b>) (If you are setting things up on
the same machine that MySQL is running on, <i>localhost</i> should be
what you are using for <b>DBHOSTNAME</b>).

<li>database name: (<b>DBNAME</b>)

(<b>TIMECARDDB</b>)

<p>
If you are going to have your database served from a machine that
is running cpanel or some other menu-based software, the method of
setting up your database should be documented there.
</p>

<p>
The chances are your setup will have you:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>create a database or databases
</li>
<li>possibly create a MySQL user
</li>
<li>add MySQL user to the database or databases

<p>
Some of the tables in the database don't yet have appropriate
front-ends, so, to customize them for your particular event, you
will need to modify them directly from the MySQL client.  As
development proceeds, these will get fewer over time.
</p>

<p>
Currently, they are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Divisions:: If you want some other divisions than Other,
Programming, Events, Fixed Functions, Hotel, Unspecified, and
Volunteer.
</li>
<li>EmailCC:: Needs to be customized for your convention.
</li>
<li>EmailFrom:: Needs to be customized for your convention.
</li>
<li>EmailTo:: Might need to be customized.
</li>
<li>Features:: List of things that can be in a room.  Might need to be
customized.
</li>
<li>Phases:: The "Phase" you are in will need to be changed as your
phase changes.
</li>
<li>PreconHours:: If you are tracking volunteer hours, the PreconHours
will probably need to be added to.
</li>
<li>PubStatuses:: Depending on the useage of the software, you might
need more statuses than Prog Staff, Public, Do Not Print, and
Volunteer.
</li>
<li>QuestionsForSurvey:: You might want to change these.
</li>
<li>RegTypes:: Depending on how you use it, the RegTypes may change.
</li>
<li>Roles:: Fairly standard, but might want to be customized for your
convention.
</li>
<li>RoomSets: Fairly standard, but might want to be customized for
your convention.
</li>
<li>Rooms:: This definitely wants to be customized for your
convention.
</li>
<li>Services:: List of services that can be provided to a room.  Might
need to be customized.
</li>
<li>SessionStatuses:: Might need to be customized for your
convention.
</li>
<li>Tracks:: Probably will want to be customized for your convention
</li>
<li>Types:: May want to be customized for your convention.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Also, some of the Permission interconnects might have to be
customized for your convention.
</p>

<p>
One set of tables that you might be updating across the life of this
instance of Zambia is the Reports table.  As people generate useful
reports, they do tend to get shared.  We hope that, should you
develop noteworthy reports, you share them back with the community
at large, as well.
</p>

<p>
Loading such reports are often as simple as:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">mysql -hDBHOSTNAME -p -uDBUSERNAME DBNAME &lt; ./NewReports.sql
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Sharing them is as simple as, say, exporting your new report called
<i>voltimepanelists</i>:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">echo "SELECT * FROM Reports WHERE reportname='voltimepanelists';" |
mysql -hDBHOSTNAME -p -uDBUSERNAME DBNAME &gt; ./NewReports.sql
</pre>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<p>
If you are going to be using Zambia and not some other registration
package, you are going to need access to the program, to begin
adding the people who are going to be working with the system.
</p>

<p>
Currently the easiest way to do so is to add the first three users,
by pulling in the Initial_Users.sql file from the <i>Install</i>
directory.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">mysql -hDBHOSTNAME -p -uDBUSERNAME DBNAME &lt; ./Inital_Users.sql
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Once you have done that, you can log in to Zambia using the badgeid
of <b>101</b> and the password of <b>changeme</b>.
</p>

<p>
You then can modify the appropriate information.  Under the <i>Manage
Participants &amp; Schedule</i> tab, there is an <i>Administer Participants</i>
choice.  Selecting that will allow you to update your password
(_important step_) and the "Edit Further" link at the bottom of
the page will allow you to update the information so it actually
matches you.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to then go and add the rest of your staff, off of the
<i>Enter Participants</i> link.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<p>
You might want to complete the activites above, just to make sure
you have access, but once you do, you can migrate the congo data
into the system, so all the other folks have their information
added.
</p>

<p>
From congo, do:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">export_program_participants_congo.sql

This generates sql that can be, in turn, locaded into Zambia.

<h3 id="sec-7-3"><span class="section-number-3">7.3</span> Not Congo</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-3">
<p>
Tying this into another registration system is slightly more
complicated.  The easiest way is to use the "regtype" field to
track the registration number that the various other registration
programs give you, and see if there is a way to massage their data
into the "CongoDump" format.

Under the <i>scripts</i> directory there is a nice little shell-script
that you can call with cron to back your information up.  If you are
to use it, make sure you create the <i>Data_Backup</i> directory under
the <i>Local</i> directory before you use it.  I back up weekly several
months before the con, start in on daily once heavy changes are
being made, so we loose less information if there is a problem, and
then about a month or so after the con, back off to weekly or
monthly.  At one point in time, I was running it hourly, just to be
sure.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
<p>
Another Con instance is approaching.  To set up for this, there is
one file and a number of table additions you need to make.  At some
point the table additions might have their own form.  Feel free to
update them any way you are comfortable with at the moment.  The
update to the Local/db_name.php file should only be the update to
the CON_KEY entry in the file, all the rest should remain the same,
and probably that should migrate to something database setable at
some point.  The rest of the information below should be set in your
database tables.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-11-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-11-1"><span class="section-number-3">11.1</span> ConInfo</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-1">
<p>
The first place to start is setting your ConInfo information.  This
allows for the con to show up in the index file, and opens all the
information up for access, addition, and whatever else you want for
your con.  If you wish to see what values were set for a previous
instance of your con (to make sure you have the right values), you
might want to use a query (replacing the $conid with the previous
con you want to model on) like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">SELECT
    *
  FROM
      ConInfo
  WHERE
    conid=$conid;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The values are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>conid: The unique number of your con.
</li>
<li>conname: The name of your con (probably inclucign either the
number, or the year of your con or other unique identifier).
</li>
<li>connumdays: How many days your con will run.
</li>
<li>constartdate: When your con begins, in the format of YYYY-MM-DD
hh:mm:ss and preferably (for ease of thought and scheduling)
having your hh:mm:ss be 00:00:00 or midnight.
</li>
<li>conurl: This should be the head of your tree, and match all the
previous conurls for this con.
</li>
<li>conlogo: This should point to the logo of your con.  If you do
not modify it event-to-event, it will probably be the same as the
previous conlogos for this con.
</li>
<li>condefaultduration: This is the default session length in hh:mm
format.
</li>
<li>condurationminutes: This is an enum set to either 'TRUE' or
'FALSE' (yes, this is somewhat misleading, and probably should be
changed to something else, globally).  If it is set to 'TRUE'
then all times will be reported as just minutes.  If it is set to
'FALSE' then all times will be in hh:mm notation where
appropriate.
</li>
<li>congridspacer: The default spacer value for the grid, in seconds.
This should probably have several entries, in case the grid wants
to be different, for different departments, but that is an
enhancement, to come.
</li>
<li>conallowkids: This is an enum set to either 'TRUE' or 'FALSE'
(yes, this is somewhat misleading, and probably should be changed
to something else, globally).  If it is set to 'TRUE' it allows
for children, and special children programming.  If it is set to
'FALSE' the special children programming will not appear.
</li>
<li>contotalsess: The maximum number of total sessions you will allow
your various people to sign up for.  This can vary due to the
length of the session, how many days your con will run, etc.
</li>
<li>condailysess: The maximum number of sessions on a particular day
you will allow your various people to sign up for.  This can vary
due to the length of the session, how many days your con will
run, how many sessions there are in a day, and how hard you are
willing to work them.
</li>
<li>conavailabilityrows: How many rows of on/off times your people
can put in, for their availability.  The longer the con, or the
shorter the session, the more rows you want to allow them to
have.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sec-11-2"><span class="section-number-3">11.2</span> Phase</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-11-2">
<p>
This also has to be set up so the appropriate Phase shifting can
happen.  The phase of the convention will shift, over time, as
deadlines approach and pass.  Not all of the phasetypeids from the
PhaseTypes table need to be there, but, it is easier if they are,
so all you have to do is change the phasestate, using the
AdminPhases.php page and the appropriate phase changes state.  If
you wish to see what values were set for a previous instance of
your con (to make sure you have the right values), you might want
to use a query (replacing the $conid with the previous con you want
to model on) like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">SELECT
    *
  FROM
      Phase
    JOIN PhaseTypes USING (phasetypeid)
  WHERE
    conid=$conid;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The values are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>phaseid: the unique key for this entry
</li>
<li>conid: The con that these phases are for.  This should be set to
whatever conid you are creating.
</li>
<li>phasetypeid: This is the phase that is being turned on or off, as
described in the PhaseTypes table.
</li>
<li>phasestate: If a phase is active.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You might wish to simply populate your phases with (replacing
$conid with the appropriate conid, and the last "," with ";"):
INSERT INTO Phase (conid, phasetypeid, phasestate) VALUES
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">SELECT
    concat("($conid,",phasetypeid,",0),") AS ValueSet
  FROM
      PhaseTypes;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
An example of phase shifting, is when you open your call for
presenters, or you close your call for vendors, or you allow
feedback.  This can change programatically on specific dates around
your con, or you can set them by hand, when you are ready for a
phase shift.  Many phases (or few) might be active at any given
point in time.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-1">
<p>
This need to be set so people can actually log into your con.  This
defines the access any particular individual might have.
Individuals might have several sets of accesses, depending on their
roles, some cover more than one area, others do not.  This gets
somewhat complex, in the interweaving of some other tables, but,
theoretcially that was set up, and still should hold true from
previous instances of your con.  Of course, tweaking from year to
year might need to happen.  If you wish to see who had which
leadership roles in a previous instance of your con (to make sure
you are rolling forward with the right roles), you might want to
use a query (replacing the $conid with the previous con you want to
model on) like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">SELECT
    concat(badgeid," - ",pubsname) as Who,
    concat(permroleid," - ",permrolename) as What
  FROM
      UserHasPermissionRole
    JOIN PermissionRoles USING (permroleid)
    JOIN Participants USING (badgeid)
  WHERE
    conid=$conid AND
    permrolename like "%Super%";
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will give you the badgeids and the permroleids to add to the
table.  It is in the format of:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>badgeid: The unique id of an individual in Zambia.
</li>
<li>permroleid: One of the set of permissions that an individual will
have for this con.
</li>
<li>conid: The con that these permission are for.  This should be set
to whatever conid you are creating.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you want to only add your particular badgeid, permroleid, conid
information, and then use the "Migrate Participant from another
con-instance" link under the "Manage Participants &amp; Schedule" tab 
to give each the right permissions, that will work as well.  But at
least you will need to be set up, so you can grant other people
access.  The use of that page is well documented in the
Presenter_Flow document in this directory.
</p>

<p>
You probably also want to add the 100-user (the Brainstorm User
called Idea Submissions), to permroleid 4 (Brainstorm) so that the
brainstorm submission system will work.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-12-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-12-2"><span class="section-number-3">12.2</span> UserHasConRole</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-2">
<p>
This is very similar to the UserHasPermissionRole, and was split
off, because not all Permission Roles want to necessarily be
advertized, and sometimes a Permission Role is a superset of a Con
Role that actually wants to be called out.  While this is not a
necessary step, it is a good one to follow, so people know who is
responsible for what, when they visit your webpage. If you wish to
see who had which leadership roles in a previous instance of your
con (to make sure you are rolling forward with the right roles),
you might want to use a query (replacing the $conid with the
previous con you want to model on) like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">SELECT
    concat(badgeid," - ",pubsname) AS Who,

    JOIN ConRoles USING (conroleid)
  WHERE
    conid=$conid;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will give you the badgeids and conroleids to add to the
table.  It is in the format of:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>badgeid: The unique id of an individual in Zambia.
</li>
<li>conroleid: A role that an individual will have for this con.
</li>
<li>conid: The con that the role is for.  This should be set to
whatever conid you are creating.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can always go back and add to this, as the shape of your con
fills in.
</p>

<p>
If you want to only add your particular badgeid, permroleid, conid
information, and then use the "Migrate Participant from another
con-instance" link under the "Manage Participants &amp; Schedule" tab

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-3">
<p>
This maps the organizational chart of your convention.  Again while
this is not a necessary step for the start of your con, and might
be added to as your con goes on, usually you know what the table of
your organization will be, even if you don't yet know who will be
filling those roles.  To see what was before you can use a query
(replacing the $conid with the previous con you want to model on)
like:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">SELECT
    concat(HR.conroleid," - ",CR.conrolename) AS Role,
    concat(hasreport," - ",CRR.conrolename) AS Report
  FROM
      HasReports HR
    JOIN ConRoles CR USING (conroleid)
    JOIN ConRoles CRR ON (hasreport=CRR.conroleid)
  WHERE
    conid=$conid;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This will give you the list of conroleids who have conroleids
reporting to them.  You can add them to the table as:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>conid: The con that these reports are for.  This should be set
to whatever conid you are creating.
</li>
<li>conroleid: This is the role that has others reporting to them
</li>
<li>hasreport: The conroleid of the position that reports to the
specified original conroleid.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
On the other hand, if you just want to mirror them, quickly, from
another instance of your con you could always (replacing $origconid
with the previous con you want to model on, and $conid with the
current one) run:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-html">SELECT
    concat("($conid,",conroleid,",",hasreport,"),") AS Prev
  FROM
      HasReports
  WHERE
    conid=$origconid;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Then just massage the data slightly, and you have the insert you
can do to mirror the previous con.
</p>

<p>
You probably want to make sure the BrainstormCoordinator (47),
reports to Programming (3).

number of possible choices.  One of the ways to do this is to break
it down by time period, another is to break it down by class type.
Once you have broken them down, this table sets up the various
possible views.  At least one view should be set to "single class",
so that the reference from the descriptions etc will work.
</p>

<p>
The values for FeedbackPages are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>fpageid: Unique key for this table (it should auto-increment).
</li>
<li>conid: For which con is this page relevant.
</li>
<li>fppagedesc: The short description of the page contents.
</li>
<li>fpagestart: The start time of the schedule elements that this
page covers.
</li>
<li>fpageend: The end time of the schedule elements that this page
covers.
</li>
<li>fpagecols: The number of columns at the top of the printed page.
</li>
<li>questiontypeid: Which type of questions will show up on this
page, from the QuestionTypes table.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
The type of schedule elements included in each possible Feedback
page is set in the FeedbackPageHasType.  This can have multiple
mappings.  For example, if you have both classes and panels, they
have different values for their typeid in the Sessions table.  To
have them both show up in the "single class" page, that page id
needs two entries in the FeedbackPageHasType table, each one
mapping the typeid to that fpageid.  "single class" should have a
mapping for every element you reference, but the feedback page for
just the classes would only have the typeid of classes mapped to
it.
</p>

<p>
The values for FeedbackPageHasType are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>fpageid: From the FeedbackPages table.
</li>
<li>typeid: From the Types table.
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-sec-15-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-15-3"><span class="section-number-3">15.3</span> Setting the TypeHasQuestionType</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-15-3">
<p>
This is implemented to be able to cross-type questions, and make
sure you wanted those question types to show up for that type of
schedule element, for this particular event.  It does allow for
some greater flexibility, as opposed to having a fixed QuestionType
for the schedule Type, since that might change from event to event.
Smaller events might want all the schedule Types to have the same
QuestionType, larger or more siloed events might want to break it
down further.  Depending on what is being fed back, Divisions might
creep into this, as well.
