* General Information
  This idea was pitched as part of the Friday Night entertainment /
  teaching point of view.  After discussions at TESFest with some of
  the title-holders, the number of people ignorant of what that was,
  much less the history, pride, and importance of it.  
** Timing
   So we thought a Friday Event would be good to help fill some of
   that gap.  Currently the Friday schedule for the Rotunda room has
   setup going on through about 5pm, so, depending on the Socials,
   this can start either at 6 or at 7, and run through 10:00, with
   cleanup and turn-over time so that the RKO Army can start by
   11:00.
