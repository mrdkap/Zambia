* General Design
  This is a working guide on how the vending portion of Zambia will be
  designed/changed.  Some of it is already in place, some has yet to
  be built.  This guide should have all the relevant bits in it so
  that all the stake-holders can have their say, and we are working
  off of one document.

  NOTE: when there is a - or a + next to things, it's because I asked
  that as a question, or made a supposition, and it was answered (by
  Amanda) so, for now at least the - is my side of the conversation
  and the + is her side of the conversation.
* Database Design
** Perennial
   These are the current values that should be migrated to the Zambia
   values if they are not already set.  The latest entries will be
   considered canonical.  The ones of these in CongoDump will be more
   or less fixed and (currently) take an act of Vendor Coordinator (or
   other back-end Zambia person) to update.  

   The ones of these in Bios can be updated by the
   Vendors. times_at_fff_untracked should also be fixed.  Not sure
   about vendor_type.  If their "DBA" name is different from their
   vendor_business_name then, that can go in the bio field.

   The logo submission has yet to be determined, but I figure it's
   going to be handled along the same lines as the picture that we
   use for Presenters.

   The bulk of the changes are in 41_VendorInfo.sql
*** id
**** DONE CongoDump.badgeid
*** vendor_address
**** DONE CongoDump.postaddress1 and CongoDump.postaddress2

**** DONE CongoDump.postcity
*** vendor_contact_email
**** DONE CongoDump.email

*** vendor_fetlife
**** DONE Bios - badgeid=id, biotype=fetlife
*** vendor_DBA
**** DONE Bios - badgeid=id, biotype=dba
*** vendor_zipcode
**** DONE CongoDump.postzip
*** vendor_type
    - New? possibly a short list of possible with a mapping to the
      vendor?
    - Might also include "community table" as a type?  If this isn't a
      short list of pickable things, we might want to make another
      table field "vendor/community table" with allowable "V" or "C"
      as part of the enum.
    - Vendor_type should be table, with a selectable (not just pull-down)
      list, and set by them.
**** DONE Needs to be created/mapped based on other Types descriptions
     - VendorTypes table vendortypeid, vendortypename, vendortypedesc
     - VendorIs table badgeid, vendortypeid
*** times_at_fff_untracked
    The number of times they vended at the fff that we currently don't
    have in the database, so that the generated number below can be
    (more) accurately generated.  As we add more instances (as I find
    them) this should probably get adjusted, so it's not artificially
    inflated. 
**** DONE VendorTimesAdj created as a standalone table vaguely similar to Interested
     badgeid, vendortimesadj
** Annual
   Most of these have to either be created, or co-opted, since the way
   that it was being done before is too baroque and complicated.  Easy
   enough to simply make new tables, and reuse little bits, instead
   of trying to force everything into the other work-flow, as we did on
   an "emergency" and "emergent" basis, originally.
*** this event's check
**** DONE combination of badgeid and conid to avoid multiple entries for an event.
*** id - varchar(15)
    linked to Participants.badgeid
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.badgeid
*** conid - int(11)
    linked to ConInfo.conid
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.conid
*** created - timestamp
    - when applied I think?
    + CORRECT
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.vendorwhenapplied
*** digital_advertising - complex
    - y/n or $ or type? 
    - do they want it? or how much?
    +  JUST A Y/N
    - Actually a drop-down / select (not a mulit-select)
    - three tables
**** DONE a list of the possible default digital advertizing types (BaseDigitalAd)
       - basedigitaladid, basedigitaladname, basedigitaladdesc
**** DONE a list of digital advertizing for this event, the prices, and the conid (DigitalAd)
       - digitaladid, basedigitaladid, conid, digitaladprice, display_order
**** DONE a mapping of VendorAnnualInfo.vendoranualid (VendorHasDigitalAd)
       - badgeid, digitaladid, digitaladcount
*** fff_sponsorship - complex
    - y/n or $ or level? 
    - will they sponsor us?
    + JUST A Y/N
    - Actually as a level.
    - three tables
**** DONE a list of the possible default digital advertizing types (BaseSponsorLevel)
       - basesponsorlevelid, basesponsorlevelname, basesponsorleveldesc
**** DONE a list of digital advertizing for this event, the prices, and the conid (SponsorLevel)
       - sponsorlevelid, basesponsorlevelid, conid, sponsorprice, display_order
**** DONE a mapping of VendorAnnualInfo.vendoranualid (VendorHasSponsorLevel)
       - badgeid, sponsorlevelid, sponsorlevelcount
*** print_advertising - complex
    - y/n or $ or type? 
    - do they want it?
    + JUST A Y/N
    - Multi-select (drop down) as a possiblity.
    - Bag stuffer
    - three tables
**** DONE a list of the possible default digital advertizing types (BaseDigitalAd)
       - baseprintadid, baseprintadname, baseprintaddesc
**** DONE a list of digital advertizing for this event, the prices, and the conid (DigitalAd)
       - printadid, baseprintadid, conid, printadprice, display_order
**** DONE a mapping of VendorAnnualInfo.vendoranualid (VendorHasDigitalAd)
       - badgeid, printadid, printadcount
*** updated - timestamp
    - most recently updated, I believe
    + CORRECT
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.vendorupdated
*** vendor_acknowledgement - varchar(50) (signature)
    - Vendor acknowledges ... something?
    + VENDOR ACKNOWLEDGES THEY AGREE TO OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS -
      THIS SHOULD BE AGREED TO ANNUALLY 
    - Possible second page, with what the agreement is.
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.vendoracknowledgement
*** vendor_additional_notes / additional_information - text
    - this might also want to be perennial as well, perhaps?
    + ANNUAL ONLY; THIS IS REGARDING REQUESTS (EX:  FUR ALLERGY, WALL,
      ETC)
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.vendornotes
*** vendor_amenities_foo - ?? (see also VendorFeatures)
    - A variety of possible fields?  How is this  used?
      - 6ft_table
      - corner_endcap
      - extra_badges
      - number_of_chairs
      - shared_electrical 8ft_tables
    +  RIGHT NOW IT'S SPLIT INTO MULTIPLE LINES WITH MULTI OPTIONS.  #
       OF TABLES, # OF CHAIRS, CORNER/END CAP, ELECTRICAL, EXTRA
       BADGES
    - three tables
**** TODO need to migrate old information somehow, as well as build the three tables
**** DONE BaseVendorFeature
     basevendorfeatureid, basevendorfeaturename, basevendorfeaturedesc
**** DONE VendorFeature based on VendorFeatures
     vendorfeatureid, basevendorfeatureid, conid, vendorfeatureprice,
     display_order
**** DONE create VendorHasFeature
     badgeid, vendorfeature, vendorfeaturecount
*** vendor_contract - varchar(5)
    - How is this used?
    + THIS IS INITIALS TO STATE THEY READ AND AGREE TO OUR TERMS ALREADY ABOVE
    - Probably not used, see above vendoracknowledgement
**** DONE see VendorAnnualInfo.vendoracknowledgement
*** vendor_invoiced - Y/N (enum)
    - Were they invoiced?
    + YUP
    - more complex, town invoice, and then us invoice.  Details probably
      involved as to what the invoice is for.
**** DONE part of Vendor Status
*** vendor_location - ??
    - Where we put them.
    + YUP
    - This might want to be slightly more complex, building, room, and
      booth-number
**** TODO VendorLocation table?
     - badgeid, conid, building, room (tied to rooms?), booth number
     - Might just do as a free form field for this year, and make it
       more complex for the future.
*** vendor_payment_adjustment - decimal(8,2)
    - Adjustments to the bill
    + YUP
    - chance for adjustments (like shitty corner)
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.vendorpayadj
*** vendor_payment_amount - decimal(8,2)
    - amount they paid, should match invoiced amounts
    + YUP
    - differentiated by the above adjustment
**** TODO not sure how it's generated?
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.vendorpaid
*** vendor_payment_received - Y/N (enum)
    - check box?
    + YES
    - default "N" or maybe blank?
    - Possibly No (blank?), Warwick, and In-full as field entries.
**** DONE part of Vendor Status
*** vendor_preferred_space - ?? (see also VendorSpaces)
    - Where they would like to be put.
    + NO - THIS IS BOOTH SIZE (SINGLE, DOUBLE, ETC)
    - What is requested - several options, this is just your
      preference, no guarentees.  (select at most 3)
    - four tables
**** DONE BaseVendorSpace based on VendorSpaces
     basevendorspaceid, basevendorspacename, basevendorspacedesc
**** DONE VendorSpace based on VendorSpaces
     - This event's options, based on VendorSpaces
     - vendorspaceid, basevendorspaceid, conid, vendorspaceprice,
       display_order
**** DONE VendorPrefSpace
     badgeid, vendorspace, vendorspacerank (enum 1st, 2nd, 3rd)
**** DONE VendorHasSpace
     badgeid, vendorspace, vendorspacecount
*** vendor_loadin_self_carry - Y/N (enum)
    - will they?
    - This should be Y/n, right?
    + YES
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.vendorselfcarry
*** vendor_sponsorship_package  - ??
    - what package they wanted?  They actually bought?
    + THIS IS THE Y/N ABOVE
    - if this is redundant it should be removed.  If it is the same as
      what is in missing, below, then ... perhaps not so missing after
      all?
    - Redundant with the first one.
**** DONE with the above.  Make sure the data is migrated appropriately.
*** vendor_status / status - Denied/Approved/Accepted/Approved/Paid (sub-table)
    + STATUS
    + DENIED, APPROVED, ACCEPTED, APPROVED AND PAID
    - Approved is in twice?  Should it be 4, Denied, Approved,
      Accepted, Paid?  I'd also add "Proposed" or the like?
    - Proposed, Applied, NELA Approval, Warwick Invoiced, Pending
      Warwick Approval, Warwick Approval, NELA Invoiced, Paid,
      Accepted, NELA Denied, Warwick Denied, Banned.
**** DONE probably based on Interested/InterestedTypes
     VendorStatusTypes - vendortypeid, display order, vendortypename,
     vendortypedesc -- populated.
     VendorStatus - conid, badgeid, vendorstatustypeid
*** rejected_reason - text
    + KEEP, WOULD BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE UNLESS VENDOR IS BANNER
**** DONE VendorAnnualInfo.vendordenyreason
*** Tracking fields similar to participant tracking on what was done.
**** DONE based on SessionEditHistory/SessionEditCodes/NotesOnParticipants
     - VendorEditHistory: vbadgeid, conid, badgeid, vendoreditcode,
       vendorstatustypeid, vendorchangets, vendordelta
     - VendorEdit Codes: vendoreditcode. display_order, vendoreditname
** Missing
   These are values that I think we need, that don't seem to actually
   exist anywhere else, and should probably be at least tracked, if
   not having several layers to them, so that they can be figured into
   things like costs, and historical data.
*** vendor_actual_space
    - single, double, room, etc. probably based on the same
      VendorSpaces/VendorHasVendorSpace etc.
    - Us modifyable, not them modifiable.
**** DONE see above under VendorHasSpace
** Generated
   These values would not actually be stored anywhere, but generated
   for various purposes, from other information collected in the
   database, rather than simple values.  The Vendor Invoice Amount
   should also go along with the Vendor Invoice, which lists all the
   things they are paying for, and interfaces with our credit-card
   system.
*** vendor_invoice_amount - decimal(13,4)
    - Money
    + YUP
    - possibly a geneerated field, as opposed to a stored one, based
      on the varieties chosen in vendor_amenites,
      vendor_payment_adjustment, vendor_actual_space and others?
*** times_at_fff 
    - currently a freeform field, should probably be generated, with a
      special number that adds in, for (currently) untracked events.
    + SOUNDS GOOD
    - Base figure above in perennial
** Structure
   These are the proposed new tables or modifications to existing
   tables that the data will be collected in.  Mostly interesting for
   building purposes, but also for those curious on how things operate
   under the hood, because, I like sharing that way, as opposed to
   keeping things secret and cryptic.  Yes, I know it's called "code"
   because we didn't want you to know what it did, but ... 
*** Vendor Constants
    - Most of these (as listed) are already in the CongoDump table.
    - Two need their own table:
      - vendor_type
        possibly a short list of possible with a mapping to the
        vendor, so might be another table
      - times_at_fff_untracked - int(3)
*** Vendor Yearly (by Event) Variables
    - Most just are, as specified in this table
    - Some might be cross-references to the other tables below, or be
      in the other tables entirely.
*** Vendor Features
    Probably just a tweak to this table, and might need to be a
    "standard set" and a "this event set" like BaseFeatures and
    Features does as well as BaseServices and Services does and a
    repurposing of "SessionHasVendorFeature" to
    "VendorHasVendorFeature"
*** Vendor Spaces
    Probably just a tweak to this table, and might need to be a
    "standard set" and a "this event set" like BaseFeatures and
    Features does as well as BaseServices and Services does and a
    repurposing of "SessionHasVendorSpace" to "VendorHasVendorSpace"
*** Vendor Location
    Might be it's own table, with conid (linked), badgeid (linked),
    building, floor, room (possibly linked), and booth_number, and
    then code around it so blanks just don't get reported (aka, if
    they are a room vendor, their booth_number might not be listed,
    but if there are several vendors in a room, it might be.)  This
    might also allow ties to maps, and possibly the redraw of maps.
*** Vendor Status
    Might want to be it's own table as a mapping, so searches, and
    display_order could be set.
*** Vendor Sponsorship Package/vendor_sponsor_level
    These three would need to be determined.
*** digital_advertising_level
    These three would need to be determined.
*** print_advertising_level
    These three would need to be determined.
*** More structure in the 41_VendorInfo.sql file
** Still Unknown
   These are the variables that exist already in the other usage
   space, that I still don't have a handle on.  More explination would
   be very useful.
*** created_by - number
    - Not sure what this does?
    + I THINK IT"S VENDORS NAME VS. I UPDATED, ETC
    - So ... how should it be expressed/tracked?
    - Probably covered by VendorAnnualInfo.vendorupdated tracking (above)
*** ordering_count - number
    - Another random number?
    + YES
    - Should it be kept?  Removed, what is it's state?  What is it's
      purpose?
    - timestamp on entry rather than something else, kept in
      timestamp, otherwise ... who knows.
    - Probably covered by VendorAnnualInfo.vendorwhenapplied
* Front End
** Available Pages
   This should be the comprehensive list of all the pages that either
   the vendors/community table folk need to interact with or those who
   manage them (the Div Head) needs to interact with.
*** Returning Vendor sign-in
    By number or email address.
    - Update page (subset of new apply page)
    - apply page (subset of new apply page)
**** VENDORQA needs to be vetted.
     - Possibly add the SuperVendor update here.
*** Returning Community Table sign-in
    By number or email address.  Might simply be switched on one of
    the values in the vending type or on it's own value, and just have
    one place to go?  Since we are collecting pretty much the same
    information for them both?  Or should I be separating them out?
    - not for this year, but community table a separate page (at least
    for winter, since they don't have to apply)
    - BIG NOTE: any money exchanged makes you a vendor, Be aware
**** TODO Currently simply a subset of vendor information.
*** New Vendor proposal
    With a catch to see if they are already in our database, using
    their email address
**** VENDORQA final vetting by the vendor folks.
*** New Community Table proposal
    With a catch to see if they are already in our database, using
    their email address
    - not for this year, but community table a separate page (at least
    for winter, since they don't have to apply)
**** TODO Currently simply a subset of vendor information.
*** Returning Vendor/Community Table informational gathering
    This can be the same, although there might, again, be a slight
    difference bases on vendor/community table differences.  Also, we
    might want to present last? event's information as defaults, so
    they have to do less typing. Dealing with changes once the state
    has changed to "invoice generated" might require Vendor Div Head
    intervention.
    - Steps to do this.  This will be several "pages" as the Welcome
    Page, depending on status.
**** VENDORQA Proposed (1) / Applied (2)
     Either Proposed (by someone else) or Applied (basically filling
     out the form we are giving, or (which isn't set up yet) a
     returning Vendor, filling out a shorter form, but will all the
     appropriate event information on it.
     - Waiting on Vendor QA of the words, and the contract.
**** VENDORQA NELA Approved (3)
     Once a set of the proposals are in, the jury decides if their
     proposal is accepted and acceptable, the NELA Approved button for
     them is clicked, email is sent to them letting them know that
     they are a NELA approved vendor, and they should log in (with
     their log in information) to go to the next step.  They see the
     second page when they log in, which has the information about
     what Warwick is doing differently this year, and a link to pull
     down the PDF to be filled in, and a way to submit the filled-out
     PDF.
     - Not sure if we should be auto-moving on.
**** VENDORQA Warwick Invoced (4)
     Once the PDF has been submitted and/or when the next button has
     been clicked, they are then presented with an invoice for the
     Warwick fees.
     - Still needs invoice testing, need a credit card for that.
**** VENDORQA Pending Warwick Approval (5)
     Once the fees have been paid and/or when the next button has been
     clicked, they are given the message, when they log in, that they
     are still pending Warwick's approval.
**** VENDORQA Warwick Approval (6)
     Once we get Warwick's approval, the button is clicked and they
     will see the message, something to the effect of "Warwick has
     approved, this is your current order, do you want to change
     anything before your invoicing (this is where the various
     digital, print, and sponsorship options, as well as the amenities
     can be changed, as well).
**** VENDORQA NELA Invoiced (7)
     Once they indicate that their invoice is fine, the invoice is
     presented.  They then can pay it.
     - Still needs testing, need a credit card for that.
     - Although the testing might be covered by Warwick Invoiced (4)
       above.
**** VENDORQA Paid (8)
     This is the state they will be in once the invoice is paid.  At
     this point, it can flow directly to the next step, but I have
     something (somewhat confusing in my notes) to the effect that
     there wants to be a check ... sent to them? or sent to us? or
     possibly that we are waiting on a check, or something else, that
     means that they are waiting in this state.
**** VENDORQA Accepted (9)
     Once this button is clicked, then everything comes up roses, they
     are on our websites, and visible, and all is good in the world.
**** VENDORQA NELA Denied (10)
     For those vendors who just didn't make the cut (this event?)
     usually would happen after (or instead of) the NELA Approved (3)
     state.
**** VENDORQA Warwick Denied (11)
     For those vendors who didn't make Warwick's cut this event (and
     can they apply again, subsequent events?  Are we going to track
     the reason Warwick rejected them?  Will we even know the reason?)
     usually would happen after (or instead of) the Warwick Approval
     state.
**** VENDORQA Banned (12)
     So we track those who are banned, so if they try to apply, we
     know.  Probably clunky, and ... not sure at what point in the
     process they should be informed.  I'm thinking at about the NELA
     Denied, right after (or instead of) the NELA Approved state as
     well.
*** Returning Vendor informational update
    This might not be necessary, based on the above page keeping what
    is set for this event as set.
**** DONE included in above Returning set of pages.
*** Returning Vendor/Community Table Bio update
    Page that they can, at will update their web or book information,
    along with all their other invormation.
**** VENDORQA similar to the above set of pages, but allowed always.
*** Invoice
    Not available until after both they are accepted (by Vendor
    Div Head), and they hit the "generate invoice" button, which
    probably should lock changes.  Once the invoice is generated, it
    should be fixed, and also payable.
    This will (of course) be a comprehensive list of everything they
    agreed to.  The invoice page should continue to be available after
    they paid, so there is a referece point to the services agreed
    to/paid for.
    - Yes, included in the above
**** DONE included in above Returning set of pages.
*** Ad Copy Submissions
    For those who have agreed to either digital or print ads, this is
    a place for them to upload/submit them.
    - Probably offline, going directly to the AD folk.
**** TODO (perhaps, at some point?)
*** Vendor Jury
    The page that all the proposed vendors, with certain bits of
    information (to be determined, since I've not seen that page yet
    in our current system) will be on for the Vendor Div Head to move
    vendors to either "Accepted" or "Denied".  Probably includes some
    vendor notes and the like, including "Denied Reasons" Also
    probably where any price adjustments happen to the invoice.  Maybe
    a grouping by Vendor Type, and leaving the ones already moved on
    from this in a different colour, so that those already accepted,
    and their type, will be shown for balance reasons.
**** VENDORQA in pieces
     - first report - which allows for changing the Vendor State is
       done.
     - set of tunable reports
     - voting page, much like other voting pages?
*** Vendor Placement
    After the invoice is paid? Or perhaps slightly different, if there
    is those that have invoice exceptions allowing for the placement
    of vendors.  Probably should have the invoice amount paid, and
    invoice amount expected on this page, to verify that they are,
    indeed, all paid up.  Also the vendor type should show up here, as
    well, so that similars can either be grouped together, or spread
    apart, as per the decision of the Div Head. May also contain
    previous placements, or links to previous maps or something useful
    along those lines.  Including the current svg of the map.
**** TODO
*** Administer Vendor Options
    Page that has the Amenities and Spaces for this event, pulled from
    the standard pool.  To be updated by the Vendor Coordinator on an
    event by event basis.
**** VENDORQA
*** Adminsiter Ad/Sponsor Options
    Page that has the Sponsor Levels, Digital Ads and Print Ads for
    this event, pulled from the standard pool.  To be updated either
    by the Vendor Div Head or the Publications Div Head on an event by
    event basis.
**** VENDORQA
     - Page is done, need the base information so that the event
       information can be selected.
*** Administer Vendor
    Where any changes are made to the vendor information (both that
    they can change and that they can't) for creation/update by Vendor
    Div Head.
**** VENDORQA
     - Still a little wonky, brings back to a less-useful page, but
       still works.  Can select by email address or by "pubsname"
       which is the business name.
*** Vendor Welcome Letter
    Generate the (physical) welcome letter to the vendors
**** TODO
*** Vendor Email
    Generate (and send) various all-vendor communications
**** TODO
*** Vendor Badges
    Generate the Vendor Badges for printing purposes.
    - No!
**** TODO even if we won't use them.
*** Vendor Tents
    Generate all the vendor "tents" to put on their tables, to mark
    their place.
    - Business Name (and DBA?) and Booth #

*** Check-in/Check-out lists
    All of the vendors expected, so they can be ticked off the list
    when they get there, and, so that when they return whatever they
    have to return at the end of the night (tax forms, possibly?) can
    be ticked off again.
    - Dock forms (room vendors vs otherwise) Each one Business Name
      and Booth number.  (several copies)
    - Master List for check in.  Second for Check out. RI vendor
      marked specially.

*** Vendors/Community Table folk apply
    They use either the returning or the new pages, select the
    appropriate features, sponsorships, and ads that they want, and
    make sure everything is as expected.
*** (If Rolling Acceptance) Jury
    If there is a rolling acceptantce of vendors and/or community
    tables, while the vendor call/community table call is open
    acceptances can roll out and then things can go forward.
    Otherwise ...
*** Phase Change
    At the appropriate time, the Con Chair or Zambia bitch close the
    call for vendors.
*** Jury
    The (rest of (if rolling acceptance is happening)) vendors and
    community tables get acceptance, which probably is an individual
    email from the Div Head, with any specific to them in information
    included, and an invitation for them to pay their invoice.
*** Invoice
    Vendors then (hopefully, magically, smoothly) pay their agreed-to
    invoices.

    community tables is submitted.

    schedules the vendors to be put in the appropriate locations on
    the day of the event.
*** Email
    Final email goes out, with any instruction reminders and if there
    is a manditory vendor meeting, or the like.
*** Welcome Letter
    Welcome lettters generated and printed, possibly stuffed in an
    envelope or folder of some sort.
    This might include some form of their (electronically) signed
    contract, and maybe invoice highlights.  Definitely includes their
    placement information, and information on how load-in and load-out
    works, etc.
*** Badges
    Badges, the appropriate number for each vendor and community
    table, are printed, and possibly stuffed as above.

*** Check-in/check-out lists printed
    So they are available on the day-of.
* Things to add, from the new:
** Logo to be uploaded
** PDF to be updated
* Conclusion
  This should cover all the bits and pieces.  If I missed any, let me
  know so this document can be updated, and the system can be tested.
  Hopfully all will work, and this can go forth as The New Way.  Until
  we change it, again, in 2-3 years *grin*.
