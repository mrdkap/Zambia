and before I introduce our speaker, let me ask, How many of you are
NELA Associates? How many of you know about the benefits of being a
NELA Associate? Well, let me tell you! First of all, you would have
gotten into this flea for ten dollars off the ticket price!<br>
For such a price you get three days of over one hundred classes and
social events! You know what else? You get a discount on classes and
events we hold throughout the year.  Also, we have our great Special
Interest Groups, including Yoga for Kinksters, Boston Toy Party,
Hypnosis, Photography, and Kaleidoscope, all of which are reduced
cost, or free to attend as part of being a NELA associate.<br>
NELA is dedicated to making the world a safer place for SM leather
fetish people. We do this by education and through advocacy. The best
way to be a powerful advocate for our civil rights is to have a lot of
associates. There is strength in numbers.<br>
If anyone is concerned about having their name on a list, let us
reassure you that as a 501(c)3 tax exempt organization not only is
your Associate dues tax deductible but your information remains
completely confidential and will never be revealed or shared. So stop
by the NELA info table at some point this weekend and sign up. Now
without further ado ...<b>
