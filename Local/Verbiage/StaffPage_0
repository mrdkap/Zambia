<P>The general flow of sessions over time is:
<UL>
  <LI>Brainstorm - New session idea put in to the system by one of our
brainstorm users. The idea may or may not be sane or good.  It could
be too big or too small or duplicative.

  <LI>Edit Me - New session idea that a participant or staff member
entered.  An idea entered by a brainstorm user that is non-offensive
should be moved to this status.  These are still rough and may well
have issues.  Still could be duplicates.

  <LI>Vetted - A real session that we would like to see happen.  At
this point the language should be fairly close to final in the
description. Spell checking and grammar checking should have happened.
It needs have publication status, a type, kid category, division and a
room set.  Please check the duration (defaults to 1 hour) and the
various things the session might need (like power, mirrors, etc.)
This is the minimal status that participants are allowed to sign up
for.  Avoid duplicates (however the list is still approximately 3
times what will actually run).

  <LI>Assigned - Session has participants assigned to it.

  <LI> Scheduled - Session is in the schedule (do not set this by hand
as the tool actually sets this for you when you schedule it in a
room!)  The language needs to match what you want to see
<b>published</b>.
