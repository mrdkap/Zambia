  <LI> ... a space designated for Presenters, Programming Volunteers, Panelists, and Demo Bottoms only.
  <LI> ... a space that, while you are welcome to hang out there, it is also the Programming Team's Ground Zero; so, you might be pressed into service.

  <LI> ... where you get all your necessary supplies for your classes, as an Introducer, when you are checking in.

  <LI> ... the place where all problems get routed through, should any occur.
<H3>Introducer: (in room)</H3>

  <LI> Pass out the feedback forms to people as they are arriving, or once seated.

     <LI> When the Runner comes to check on the room, you can let them know if there is anything needed.  This could be anything from missing supplies, to wrong handouts, to a lack of water.
     <LI> If there is vending in the class, you might need to mind the table, while the presenter is presenting, if they don't already have someone assisting them.  You are not required to vend anything.

  <LI> Stay at the door during class to ensure that excessive ins and outs don't occur.
