      <P>Welcome to the 38<SUP>th</SUP> Fetish Fair Fleamarket!<br><br>

      You're part of a lineup of many fantastic presenters teaching
      on a great diversity of topics.  It's one of the finest
      assemblages of kinky knowledge out there!<br><br>

      But we couldn't have done it without <B>you</B>!  We just
      can't put on the Flea without the help of dozens of people, from
      the volunteers to the Board of Directors, and especially our
      wonderful presenters.  Every little bit counts, and you
      definitely don't do only a "little bit!"  We really appreciate
      you giving of your time, energy and knowledge to help foster
      education and fun.<br><br>

      Thanks so much for all that you do – the Flea wouldn't be the
      same without you!<br><br>

      On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Programming
      Department – thank you, thank you very much.<br><br><br>


      Best regards,<br><br><br>


      Percival du Chat Gris<br>
      Director of Programming</P>
