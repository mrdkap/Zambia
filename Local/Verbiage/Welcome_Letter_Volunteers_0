      <P>Welcome to the 38<SUP>th</SUP> Fetish Fair Fleamarket!<br><br>

      You're part of fantastic group of helpful and dedicated
      volunteers working to help us with presenter introductions, door
      monitoring and a myriad of other essential tasks.<br><br>

      But we couldn't have done it without <B>you</B>!  We can't
      put on the Flea without the help of dozens of people, from the
      presenters to the Board of Directors, and not to mention our
      wonderful volunteers.  Every little bit counts, and the
      volunteers definitely don't do only a "little bit!"  We really
      appreciate you giving of your time and energy to help foster
      education and fun.<br><br>

      Thanks so much for all that you do – the Flea wouldn’t be the
      same without you!<br><br>

      On behalf of the Board of Directors and the Programming
      Department – thank you, thank you very much.<br><br><br>


      Best regards,<br><br><br>


      Percival du Chat Gris<br>
      Director of Programming</P>
